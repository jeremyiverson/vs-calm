* VSCalm
VSCalm is an extension for Visual Studio 11 Beta to make the ::: TOOL WINDOW TITLES :::::: look a bit more calm.

** Obsolete
With the official release of Visual Studio 2012, VSCalm is no longer needed. To change the capitalized menu headers, you can simply [[http://www.richard-banks.org/2012/06/how-to-prevent-visual-studio-2012-all.html][add a registry entry]].

I will leave this up anyway, as the source code may be a useful reference for creating VS plugins that modify the VS user interface.

** Features
- Change the capital letters to normal title case
- Remove the colon-like gripper bars
